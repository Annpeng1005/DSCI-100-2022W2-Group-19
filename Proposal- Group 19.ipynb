    "Data science and STEM careers are growing in popularity as more businesses leverage technological advances to solve challenges and streamline operations. Among them, students who are waiting for employment or employees who want to change careers are very curious about what can be the mean factors that impact the tracjectory of salaries and bonuses among the top 5 companies counts from our data. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the most relevant predictors from the data set to relate to the potential impact on a person's career in STEM and data science. This is to suggest that the job seekers can be more insightful and intentional with their development and career path. The dataset we will be working with is the \"Data Science and STEM Salary\" dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on numerous job titles and other criteria, and has 62,000 salary records from the leading organizations for this project.
